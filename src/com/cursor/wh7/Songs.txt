I could never earn Your heart  badly
I could never reach that far  badly badly
But You have pulled me close
You've never let me go
I'm safe forever in Your arms
Your promises I can not break
And I know You will never change

Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal
Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal  badly
More faithful than the rising sun   badly
This grace for me I can't outrun
Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal

You are always there for me  badly
You listen every time I speak
You look into my eyes  badly
You see the things I hide
And say that You will never leave   badly
Your promises I can not break
And I know You will never change

Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal
Your love is, Your love  badly
Your love is loyal
More faithful than the rising sun
This grace for me I can't outrun
Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal

When my world shakes
Your love remains unshaken
So constant, so perfect, unwavering
When my world falls
Your love remains unfailing
So constant, so perfect, unwavering
So constant, so perfect, unwavering

Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal
Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal
Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal
More faithful than the rising sun
This grace for me I can't outrun
Your love is, Your love is
Your love is loyal

Loyal




Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon
The highest bough
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon
The highest bough
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now



Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world, in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy, in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Ohoh night divine, oh night, oh night divine
